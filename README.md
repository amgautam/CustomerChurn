# CustomerChurn

Using AI to classify Customer Churn

This code contains applying Binary Classification algorithms to classify Customer Churn based on Customer behavior and product features.

I have applied Gradient Boosting Algorithm like Catboost to solve this issue.

This Code contains Data Cleaning, Exploration, Feature Engineering, Model training and Tuning.


Note: This model can be further improved and also tuned ahead and feature engineering can be improved as well.
